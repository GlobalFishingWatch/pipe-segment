# How to Use the QA Notebooks

1. Create a new folder under `runs/` called `YYYYMMDD/` with the date of the pipeline run you are QAing.
2. Copy the notebooks in `templates/` into that new folder.
3. Update the tables in each notebook to match what you are comparing/QAing.
3. Modify your copy of the notebooks templates as needed.
